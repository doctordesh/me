      <h2>What about me?</h2>
      <p>
        So, who am I? My name is Emil and I'm a developer, gamer and a musician amongst other things, but foremost a developer.
        I live and breathe code and I love the craftsmanship of programming. Beautiful code is like art, magnificent and wonderful art! I love to try out
        new technologies and keep up with the latest practices, pushing the boundaries that is my own knowledge.
      </p>
      <p>
        As a person, I really like to develop my mind, to discuss ideas about the world and life.
        I find it interesting to meet new people because they always have a perspective that I do not. 
      </p>
      <p>
        When I'm not programming I like to go for a run or lift weights at the gym, cook a good meal or enjoy a movie. I read a lot of books and I
        watch Youtube series about physics, maths and astronomy. 
      </p>
      <p>
        And coffee, I really like coffee!

        An app that's been featured countless times by Apple, and it also won the Best Watch App of the 
        year 2016 (Apple reward). 
      </p>
      <p>
        As a developer at Perigee I've come in contact with a lot of the iOS technologies. It's an app that
        pushes the platform with 3D-models, On Demand Resources, HealthKit, subscriptions, SpriteKit animations
        on the Apple Watch, and much more. 
      </p>
      <p>
        I have also designed and built a backend sync engine for our users, including the client. A backend 
        that scales horizontally and makes sure that all the user's data is in sync.
